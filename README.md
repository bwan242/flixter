### Notes
My macOS VM was slow, but I was eventually able to follow along the tutorials. I was able to install "Command Line Tools" for Xcode but unable to uninstall cocoapods due to errors being thrown on the terminal. I will need to investigate this further or see if there is another API that I can use for importing the images.
